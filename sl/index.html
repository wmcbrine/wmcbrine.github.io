<h1><a href="../index.html">William McBrine</a> /
Add-ons and Utilities for Searchlight</h1>

<p>My programs for use with Searchlight BBS, including Valence and Fast
Index.</p>

<h2>Valence QWK Door</h2>

<p>
The most popular offline mail system for SL, offering much more than
Searchlight's internal QWK. It has full support of color codes, included
files, metacharacters, bulletins, and much more. Powerful, flexible,
fast, easy setup.  It also does QWK networking. For all versions of
Searchlight BBS from 2.15C on. Freeware. See also
<a href="sl-y2k.html">Searchlight in the Year 2000</a> and
<a href="QWK-features.html">QWK comparison chart</a>.
</p>

<p><a class="dl" href="valen17d.zip">Download version 1.7d (149k)</a></p>

<h2>Fast Index</h2>

<p>
A fast, accurate replacement for the SL nodelist index builder
(INDEX.EXE). Works with all versions of Searchlight. Now GPL'd!
</p>

<p><a class="dl" href="fastix3d.zip">Download version 3.0d (107k)</a></p>

<h2>Makedate</h2>

<p>
Date fixer for Searchilght BBS; a program to convert year 2000 and later
dates in the Searchlight message base between the "old" and "new"
formats. THIS IS NEEDED TO MAKE SLMAIL WORK NOW, at least some versions.
Now GPL'd!
</p>

<p><a class="dl" href="mkdat12c.zip">Download version 1.2c (22k)</a></p>

<h2>SL miscellaneous utilities</h2>

<p>
My lesser Searchlight utilities, now collected in one package: Member
List and Purge, Mail List and Purge, and the ALIAS.SL2 builder. This
archive replaces MEMBUT21.ZIP, ALIASBLD.ZIP, and MAILUTIL.ZIP. The only
real difference is that Member List has been updated for Y2K.
</p>

<p><a class="dl" href="slmisc13.zip">Download version 1.3 (70k)</a></p>
