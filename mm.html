<h2>NAME</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">mm - offline
mail reader for Blue Wave, QWK, OMEN, SOUP and OPX
packets</p>

<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mm [-option1
value] [-option2 value] [...] [filename1] [filename2]
[...]</b></p>

<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">MultiMail is an
offline mail packet reader, supporting the Blue Wave, QWK,
OMEN, SOUP and OPX formats. It uses a simple curses-based
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SOUP is used
for Internet email and Usenet. The other formats are
primarily used with dialup (or telnet) BBSes, to save
connect time and to provide a better interface to the
message base.</p>

<a name="USAGE"></a>
<h2>USAGE</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On most
screens, a summary of the available keystroke commands is
displayed in the lower part of the screen. (You can disable
this, and reclaim some screen real estate, by turning on
&quot;ExpertMode&quot;.) Note that for lack of space, not
all commands are listed on every screen where they&rsquo;re
available. For example, the search functions, which are
available everywhere, are summarized only in the packet list
and address book. The principle, albeit not one that&rsquo;s
consistently implemented, is that the summary need appear
only on the first screen where the commands are available.
When in doubt, try one and see if it works. :-)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the letter
window or ANSI viewer, pressing F1 or &rsquo;?&rsquo; will
bring up a window listing the available commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The basic
navigation keys, available throughout the program, consist
of the standard cursor and keypad keys, with &lt;Enter&gt;
to select. For terminals without full support for these
keys, aliases are available for some of them:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ESC = Q <br>
PgDn = B <br>
PgUp = F <br>
Right = + <br>
Left = -</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(Although shown
in capitals, these may be entered unshifted.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With
&quot;Lynx-style navigation&quot;, activated by the
&quot;UseLynxNav&quot; option, the Left arrow key backs out
from any screen, while the Right arrow key selects. The plus
and minus keys are no longer aliases for Right and Left, but
perform the same functions as in the traditional navigation
system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Of special note
is the space bar. In most screens, it functions as an alias
for PgDn; but in the letter window, it works as a
combination PgDn/Enter key, allowing you to page through an
area with one key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the area
list, the default view (selectable in the .mmailrc) is of
Subscribed areas only, or of Active areas (i.e., those with
messages) if the Subscribed areas are unknown. By pressing
L, you can toggle between Active, All, and Subscribed views.
(Some formats, like plain QWK, don&rsquo;t have any way to
indicate subscribed areas. In other cases, you may have
received an abbreviated area list, so that the Subscribed
and All views are the same.) In all modes, areas with
replies always appear, flagged with an &rsquo;R&rsquo; in
the leftmost column.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the letter
list, only unread messages are displayed, by default; but
you can toggle this by pressing L. If there are any marked
messages, L first switches to a marked-only mode, then to
all messages, then back to unread-only. Also, the default
mode -- unread or all -- can be set in the .mmailrc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Multiple sort
modes are available in the packet and letter lists; you can
cycle through them by pressing &rsquo;$&rsquo;. The default
sort modes are set in the .mmailrc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Options can be
specified on the command line as well as in the .mmailrc.
Option names are the same as those which appear there,
though they must be prefaced by one or two dashes, and
should not be followed by a colon. There must be a space
between the option name and the value; values which include
spaces must be quoted. All options must be specified before
any packet names or directories on the line. Finally,
options which take a filename or path should always include
the full path. (This is not, however, necessary for packet
names.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Packet names
may be specified on the command line, bypassing the packet
menu. If multiple packets are named, they&rsquo;ll be opened
sequentially. If a directory is specified instead of a file,
the packet window will by opened on that directory, and no
further items will be read from the command line.
&rsquo;T&rsquo; in the packet menu may need clarification:
it stamps the highlighted file with the current date and
time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can abort
the program immediately from any screen with CTRL-X. You
won&rsquo;t be prompted to confirm the exit, but you will
still be prompted to save replies and pointers (unless
autosaving is set). Note that if you&rsquo;ve specified
multiple packets on the command line, this is the only way
to terminate the sequence prematurely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can obtain
a temporary command shell anywhere by pressing CTRL-Z. In
the DOSish ports (MS-DOS, OS/2, Windows), it spawns a
command shell, and you return to MultiMail via the
&quot;exit&quot; command. In Unix, it relies on the shell to
put MultiMail in the background; you return with
&quot;fg&quot;. (This has always been available in the Unix
versions; however, it won&rsquo;t work if MultiMail
wasn&rsquo;t launched from an interactive shell, or if the
shell doesn&rsquo;t support it.)</p>

<a name="MOUSING"></a>
<h2>MOUSING</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">MultiMail is
mousable on many platforms: X, SDL, the Linux console (with
gpm), Windows, DOS and OS/2. (You can still use selection
with X and gpm, too; to select or paste, hold down the shift
key.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In each list
window, button 1 highlights a line, or selects it (the same
as pressing Enter) if it&rsquo;s already highlighted.
Double-click to select it immediately. Click on the
scrollbar to page up or down, or on the line just above or
below it to scroll a line at a time. In the packet, area,
and letter lists, click on the appropriate part of the
window title to change the sort or list type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the letter
window, page up by clicking in the top half of the message
text, or down (and on to the next message) by clicking in
the bottom half (equivalent to the space bar). Scroll the
message a single line up or down by clicking on the status
bars at top and bottom. The status flags &quot;Read&quot;
and &quot;Marked&quot; can be toggled by clicking on them;
clicking on &quot;Save&quot; saves, clicking on
&quot;Repl&quot; starts a reply (followup; i.e., the same as
&rsquo;R&rsquo;), and &quot;Pvt&quot; starts a private reply
(email or netmail; i.e., same as &rsquo;N&rsquo;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In text-entry
windows, button 1 works the same as the Enter key; and the
dialog boxes work in the obvious way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Button 3 backs
out of any screen, equivalent to ESC.</p>

<a name="SEARCHING"></a>
<h2>SEARCHING</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
case-insensitive search function is available on all
screens. Press &rsquo;/&rsquo; to specify the text to look
for, or &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; or &rsquo;.&rsquo; to repeat the
last search.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">New searches
(specified with &rsquo;/&rsquo;) always start at the
beginning of the list or message. Repeat searches (with
&rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; or &rsquo;.&rsquo;) start with the line
below the current one. You can take advantage of this to
manually adjust the starting point for the next search.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Searches
started in the letter, area or packet lists allow the
searches to extend below the current list. &quot;Full
text&quot; searches all the way through the text of each
message; &quot;Headers&quot; searches only the message
headers (the letter list), &quot;Areas&quot; only the area
list, and &quot;Pkt list&quot; only the packet list. So, a
&quot;Full text&quot; search started from the packet list
will search every message in every packet (but only in the
current directory).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When scanning
&quot;Full text&quot;, the automatic setting of the
&quot;Read&quot; marker is disabled. However, if you find a
search string in the header of a message and then select it
manually, the marker will be set. But if you start scanning
from the packet list, and exit the packet via a repeat
search, the last-read markers won&rsquo;t be saved.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Scans of
&quot;Headers&quot; or &quot;Full text&quot; that start from
the area list or packet list will automatically expand the
letter lists they descend into. Similarly, scans that start
at the packet list will expand the area lists. Otherwise, if
you&rsquo;re viewing the short list, that&rsquo;s all that
will be searched.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I hope the
above makes some sense. :-) The searching functions are
difficult to explain, but easy to use.</p>

<a name="FILTERING"></a>
<h2>FILTERING</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A new twist on
searching, as of version 0.43, is filtering. This is
available in all of the list windows, but not the letter or
ANSI viewer. Unlike searching, it always applies only to the
current list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Press
&rsquo;|&rsquo; to bring up the filter prompt, and specify
the text to filter on. To clear a filter, press
&rsquo;|&rsquo;, and then press return at a blank filter
prompt. (A string that&rsquo;s not found in the list will
have the same effect.) Press ESC to leave the filter as it
was.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The list will
now be limited to those items that contain the text you
entered, and that text will appear at the end of the
window&rsquo;s title as a reminder. The filter will be
retained through lower levels, but will be cleared by
exiting to a higher level. Note that a search in, e.g., the
letter list will search only the message headers (and only
those which are visible in the list), and not the
bodies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the filter
is active in the letter list, the &quot;All&quot; option in
the Save menu will save only the items that match the
filter. This can be used as a quick alternative to marking
and saving. You can also combine filtering and marking.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Changing modes
and sort types will not clear the filter. A search in a
filtered list will search only the items that match the
filter.</p>

<a name="OFFLINE CONFIGURATION"></a>
<h2>OFFLINE CONFIGURATION</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Offline config
is limited to subscribe (add) and unsubscribe (drop)
functions. The Blue Wave, OPX, OMEN, QWKE, and QWK Add/Drop
(with DOOR.ID) methods are supported. (The QMAIL
&quot;CONFIG&quot; method is not supported.) Offline config
is not available in SOUP mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the area
list, press &rsquo;U&rsquo; or &rsquo;Del&rsquo; to
unsubscribe from the highlighted area. To subscribe to a new
conference, first expand the list (&rsquo;L&rsquo;), then
highlight the appropriate area and press &rsquo;S&rsquo; or
&rsquo;Ins&rsquo;. Dropped areas are marked with a minus
sign (&rsquo;-&rsquo;) in the first column; added areas with
a plus (&rsquo;+&rsquo;). In the expanded area list,
already-subscribed areas are marked with an asterisk
(&rsquo;*&rsquo;). (This and also applies to the little area
list. With plain QWK packets, the asterisk should not be
relied upon; other areas may also be subscribed.) Added or
dropped areas are highlighted in the &quot;Area_Reply&quot;
color. Yeah, I&rsquo;ll have to change that name now.
;-)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pressing
&rsquo;S&rsquo; on an area marked with &rsquo;-&rsquo;, or
&rsquo;U&rsquo; on an area marked &rsquo;+&rsquo; turns the
flag off again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Blue Wave,
OPX, OMEN or QWKE mode, the list of added and dropped areas
is read back in when the reply packet is reopened. If the
reply packet has already been uploaded, and you&rsquo;re
reading a packet with the altered area list, this is benign.
If it&rsquo;s an older packet, you can alter the list before
uploading, as with reply messages. In QWK Add/Drop mode, the
changed area flags are converted to reply messages when the
reply packet is saved. Note: Adding or dropping areas sets
the &quot;unsaved replies&quot; flag, like entering a reply
message, but does not invoke automatic reply packet saving
until you exit the packet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately,
the OMEN mode has not actually been tested; but I believe it
conforms to the specs. Reports welcome.</p>

<a name="HIDDEN LINES AND ROT13"></a>
<h2>HIDDEN LINES AND ROT13</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the letter
window, you can toggle viewing of Fidonet &quot;hidden&quot;
lines (marked with a ^A in the first position) by pressing
&rsquo;x&rsquo;. The lines are shown as part of the text,
but in a different color. In Internet email and Usenet
areas, the full headers of the messages are available in the
same way (if provided in the packet -- generally, full
headers are available in SOUP, and partial extra headers in
Blue Wave).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pressing
&rsquo;d&rsquo; toggles rot13 encoding, the crude
&quot;encryption&quot; method used for spoiler warnings and
such, primarily on Usenet.</p>

<a name="ANSI VIEWER"></a>
<h2>ANSI VIEWER</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a message
contains ANSI color codes, you may be able to view it as
originally intended by activating the ANSI viewer. Press
&rsquo;v&rsquo; to start it. Press &rsquo;q&rsquo; to leave
the ANSI viewer; the navigation keys are the same as in the
mail-reading window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ANSI viewer
includes support for animation. While within the ANSI
viewer, press &rsquo;v&rsquo; again to animate the picture.
Press any key to abort the animation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ANSI viewer
is also used to display the new files list and bulletins, if
any are present.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">New in version
0.43 is support for the &rsquo;@&rsquo; color codes used by
PCBoard and Wildcat. This is on by default in the ANSI
viewer, but it can be toggled to strip the codes, or pass
them through untranslated, by pressing &rsquo;@&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of version
0.46, the ANSI viewer also includes limited support for
AVATAR (level 0) and BSAVE (text only) screens. These can be
toggled via ^V and ^B, respectively.</p>

<a name="CHARACTER SETS"></a>
<h2>CHARACTER SETS</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">MultiMail
supports automatic translation between two character sets:
the IBM PC set (Code Page 437), and Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1).
Messages can be in either character set; the set is
determined by the area attributes -- Internet and Usenet
areas default to Latin-1, while all others default to IBM --
and by a CHRS or CHARSET kludge, if one is present. OMEN
packets indicate their character set in the INFOxy.BBS file.
MultiMail translates when displaying messages and creating
replies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Unix
versions of MultiMail assume that the console uses Latin-1,
while the DOSish versions (DOS, OS/2, and Windows) assume
the IBM PC set. You can override this via the .mmailrc
option &quot;Charset&quot;, or on a temporary basis by
pressing &rsquo;c&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
use a different character set by disabling the conversion in
MultiMail, and letting your terminal handle it. For SOUP
packets, and for Internet or Usenet areas in other packets,
everything will be passed through unchanged if you set
MultiMail to &quot;Latin-1&quot;. For most other packet
types, setting MultiMail to &quot;CP437&quot; will have the
same effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Beginning with
version 0.33, a new character set variable is available:
&quot;outCharset&quot;. This is a string which MultiMail
puts into the MIME identifier lines in SOUP replies if the
text includes 8-bit characters. It&rsquo;s also used for the
pseudo-QP headers which are generated under the same
conditions; and when displaying such headers, MultiMail only
converts text back to 8-bit if the character set matches.
The default is &quot;iso-8859-1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default, if
a header line in a SOUP reply contains 8-bit characters,
MultiMail now writes it out with RFC 2047 (pseudo-QP)
encoding. You can disable this for mail and/or news replies
via the &quot;UseQPMailHead&quot; and
&quot;UseQPNewsHead&quot; options, though I don&rsquo;t
recommend it. The bodies can also be encoded in
quoted-printable; this is now on by default for mail, and
off for news. The options &quot;UseQPMail&quot; and
&quot;UseQPNews&quot; toggle QP encoding. (The headers and
bodies of received messages will still be converted to
8-bit.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">QP decoding is
temporarily disabled when you toggle the display of hidden
lines (&rsquo;X&rsquo;) in the letter window, so that you
can see the raw text of the message.</p>

<a name="ADDRESS BOOK"></a>
<h2>ADDRESS BOOK</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The address
book in MultiMail is intended primarily for use with
Fido-style Netmail or Internet email areas, in those packet
types which support these. When entering a message (other
than a reply) into such an area, the address book comes up
automatically. It&rsquo;s also possible to use the name
portion of an address from the address book even when
Fido/Internet addressing isn&rsquo;t available, by starting
a new message via CTRL-E instead of &rsquo;E&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can pull up
the address book from most screens by pressing
&rsquo;A&rsquo;, which allows you to browse or edit the
list. While reading in the letter window, you can grab the
current &quot;From:&quot; address by invoking the address
book and pressing &rsquo;L&rsquo;.</p>

<a name="TAGLINE WINDOW"></a>
<h2>TAGLINE WINDOW</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From most
screens, you can pull up the tagline window to browse or
edit the list by pressing CTRL-T. As of version 0.43, you
can toggle sorting of the taglines by pressing
&rsquo;$&rsquo; or &rsquo;S&rsquo;.</p>

<a name="REPLY SPLITTING"></a>
<h2>REPLY SPLITTING</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Replies may be
split, either automatically, or manually via CTRL-B in the
reply area. For automatic splitting, the default maximum
number of lines per part is set in the .mmailrc. The split
occurs whenever the reply packet is saved. This allows you
to defer the split and still re-edit the whole reply as one.
However, with autosave on, the split will occur immediately
after entering a reply (because the save does, too). Setting
MaxLines in the .mmailrc to 0 disables automatic splitting;
manual splitting is still allowed. Attempts to split at less
than 20 lines are assumed to be mistakes and are
ignored.</p>

<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
<h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">MultiMail uses
the HOME or MMAIL environment variable to find its
configuration file, .mmailrc; and EDITOR for the default
editor. MMAIL takes precedence over HOME if it&rsquo;s
defined. If neither is defined, the startup directory is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The use of
EDITOR can be overridden in .mmailrc; however, environment
variables can&rsquo;t be used within .mmailrc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You should also
make sure that your time zone is set correctly. On many
systems, that means setting the TZ environment variable. A
typical value for this variable is of the form
&quot;EST5EDT&quot; (that one&rsquo;s for the east coast of
the U.S.A.).</p>

<a name="FILES"></a>
<h2>FILES</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The only
hardwired file is the configuration file: <b>.mmailrc
(mmail.rc in DOS, OS/2 or Windows).</b> It&rsquo;s used to
specify the pathnames to MultiMail&rsquo;s other files, and
the command lines for external programs (the editor and the
archivers).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
other files are placed in the MultiMail home directory
($HOME/mmail or $MMAIL). Directories specified in the
.mmailrc are created automatically; the default Unix values
are shown here: <b><br>
~/mmail</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">To store the tagline file,
netmail addressbook, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>taglines</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A plain text file, one tagline
per line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>addressbook (address.bk in
DOS, OS/2 or Windows)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A list of names and
corresponding Fido netmail or Internet email addresses. Note
that Internet addresses are prefaced with an
&rsquo;I&rsquo;.</p>

<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>~/mmail/down</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">To store the packets as they
came from the bbs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>~/mmail/up</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">To store the reply packet(s)
which you have to upload to the bbs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>~/mmail/save</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The default directory for
saving messages.</p>

<a name="CONFIG FILE"></a>
<h2>CONFIG FILE</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The config file
(see above) is a plain text file with a series of values,
one per line, in the form &quot;KeyWord: Value&quot;. The
case of the keywords is not signifigant. Additional, comment
lines may be present, starting with &rsquo;#&rsquo;; you can
remove these or add your own. (But note that the comments
are replaced by the defaults when you upgrade to a new
version.) If any of the keywords are missing, default values
will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of version
0.41, any of these keywords except &quot;Version&quot; may
also be specified on the command line. Command-line options
take precedence over those in the config file, but their
effect is not guaranteed -- some internal pathnames are
initialized before the command line is read, for
example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here are the
keywords and their functions: <b><br>
Version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the version of
MultiMail which last updated the file. This is used to check
whether the file should be updated and the &quot;new
version&quot; prompt displayed. Note that old values are
preserved when the file is updated; the update merely adds
any keywords that are new. This keyword is also used in the
colors file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>UserName</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Your name in plain text, e.g.,
&quot;UserName: William McBrine&quot;. This is used together
with InetAddr to create a default &quot;From:&quot; line for
SOUP replies; and by itself in OMEN for display purposes
(the actual From name is set on upload), and for matching
personal messages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>InetAddr</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Your Internet email address,
e.g., &quot;InetAddr: wmcbrine@gmail.com&quot;. This is
combined with the UserName in the form &quot;UserName
&lt;InetAddr&gt;&quot; (&quot;William McBrine
&lt;wmcbrine@gmail.com&gt;&quot;) to create a default
&quot;From:&quot; line for SOUP replies. Note that if
neither value is specified, and nothing is typed manually
into the From: field when creating a message, no From: line
will be generated -- which is perfectly acceptable to at
least some SOUP programs, like UQWK.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>QuoteHead, InetQuote</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">These strings are placed at the
beginning of the quoted text when replying in normal or
Internet/Usenet areas, respectively. (The distinction is
made because the quoting conventions for BBSes and the
Internet are different.) Replaceable parameters are
indicated with a &rsquo;%&rsquo; character, as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">%f =
&quot;From&quot; in original message <br>
%t = To <br>
%d = Date (of original message) <br>
%s = Subject <br>
%a = Area <br>
%n = newline (for multi-line headers) <br>
%% = insert an actual percent character</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
can&rsquo;t put white space at the start of one of these
strings (it will be eaten by the config parser), but you can
get around that by putting a newline first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>mmHomeDir</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">MultiMail&rsquo;s home
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>TempDir</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the directory where
MultiMail puts its temporary files -- by default, as of
0.45, the same as mmHomeDir. The files are actually created
within a subdirectory of this directory; the subdirectory is
named &quot;workNNNN&quot;, where NNNN is a random number
(checked against any existing files or directories before
being created).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>signature</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Path to optional signature
file, which should be a simple text file. If specified, it
will be appended to every message you write. You should give
the full path, not just the name.</p>

<table width="100%" border=0 rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>

<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top"><b>editor</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em" valign="top">The editor
MultiMail uses for replies, along with any command-line
options. This may also be a good place to insert
spell-checkers, etc., by specifying a batch file here. Note
that the default value is just the editor that&rsquo;s
(almost) guaranteed to be available, for a given OS
(although the Unix &quot;EDITOR&quot; environment variable
is checked first), and is in no way a preferred editor; you
can and should change it.</p></td>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PacketDir</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Default packet directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ReplyDir</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Default reply packet
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SaveDir</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Default directory for saved
messages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>AddressBook</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Path and filename of the
address book. (You might change this to share it with
another installation, but basically this keyword isn&rsquo;t
too useful.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>TaglineFile</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Path and filename of the
tagline file. This could be altered from a batch file to
swap between different sets of taglines. (But note that this
value is only read at startup.) You could also share
taglines with another program, but be careful with that;
MultiMail truncates the lines at 76 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ColorFile</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Path and filename of the colors
file. See COLORS.md.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>UseColors</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Yes/No. This governs whether
color is used, or monochrome. When colors are disabled, the
terminal&rsquo;s default foreground and background colors
are used. It&rsquo;s also a crude way to implement
transparency (the only way, if you&rsquo;re not using
ncurses or PDCurses/SDL) -- the entire background will be
transparent when using an appropriate terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Transparency</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Yes/No. Only available in
ncurses or PDCurses for SDL. (The option will appear, but
not work, in non-ncurses, non-PDCurses platforms.) When this
is set to Yes, all areas where the background color is the
same as the background color set in the
&quot;Main_Back&quot; line, in the colors file, are instead
set to the default background color, and thus become
transparent areas in those terminal programs, like Eterm and
Gnome Terminal, that support this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>BackFill</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Yes/No. Normally the background
area is filled with a checkerboard pattern (ACS_BOARD
characters, in curses terms). You can disable that here,
leaving those areas as flat background color. This option is
intended mostly to make transparency more effective, but it
might help with any color scheme.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>*UncompressCommand,
*CompressCommand</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Command lines (program name,
options, and optionally the path) for the archivers to
compress and uncompress packets and reply packets. ZIP, ARJ,
RAR, LHA and tar/gzip are recognized. The
&quot;unknown&quot; values are a catch- all, attempted for
anything that&rsquo;s not recognized as one of the other
four types; if you have to deal with ARC or ZOO files, you
might define the archiver for them here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PacketSort</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The packet list can be sorted
either in inverse order of packet date and time (the newest
at the top), or in alphabetical order by filename.
&quot;Time&quot; specifies the former, and &quot;Name&quot;
the latter. (Actually only the first letter is checked, and
case is not signifigant. This applies to the other keywords
of this type (the kind that have a fixed set of values to
choose from) as well.) The sort type specified here is only
the default, and can be toggled from the packet window by
pressing &rsquo;$&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>AreaMode</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The default mode for the area
list: &quot;All&quot;, &quot;Subscribed&quot;, or
&quot;Active&quot;. This is the mode that will be used on
first opening a packet, but it can be changed by pressing L
while in the area list or little area list. For a
description of the modes, see USAGE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LetterSort</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The sort used by default in the
letter list. Can be &quot;Subject&quot; (subjects sorted
alphabetically, with a case-insensitive compare),
&quot;Number&quot; (sorted by message number),
&quot;From&quot; or &quot;To&quot;. (This can be overridden,
as in the packet list.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LetterMode</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The default mode for the letter
list: &quot;All&quot; or &quot;Unread&quot;. This is the
mode used on first opening an area; it can be toggled by
pressing L. (The Marked view is also available in the letter
list, but cannot be set as the default here.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ClockMode</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The display mode for the clock
in the upper right corner of the letter window:
&quot;Time&quot; (of day), &quot;Elapsed&quot; (since
MultiMail started running), or &quot;Off&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>Charset</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The character set that the
console is assumed to use. Either &quot;CP437&quot; (code
page 437, the U.S. standard for the IBM PC and clones) or
&quot;Latin-1&quot; (aka ISO-8859-1, the standard for most
other systems). Note that the character set of messages is
determined separately (q.v.).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>UseTaglines</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Yes/No. If no, the tagline
window is not displayed at all when composing a message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>AutoSaveReplies</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Yes/No. If yes, the reply
packet is saved automatically -- the equivalent of pressing
F2, but without a confirmation prompt -- whenever the
contents of the reply area are changed. This can be
convenient, and even a safety feature if your power supply
is irregular, but it provides less opportunity to take back
a change (like deleting a message). If no, you&rsquo;re
prompted whether to save the changes on exiting the packet.
Note that if you say no to that prompt, nothing that you
wrote during that session will be saved (unless you saved it
manually with F2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>StripSoftCR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Yes/No. Some messages on
Fido-type networks contain spurious instances of character
141, which appears as an accented &rsquo;i&rsquo; in code
page 437. These are really so-called &quot;soft
returns&quot;, where the message was wrapped when composing
it, but not indicating a paragraph break. Unfortunately, the
character can also appear legitimately as that accented
&rsquo;i&rsquo;, so this option defaults to no. It can be
toggled temporarily via the &rsquo;I&rsquo; key in the
letter window, and it doesn&rsquo;t apply to messages in the
Latin-1 character set. This is now applied only in Blue Wave
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>BeepOnPers</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Yes/No. If yes, MultiMail beeps
when you open a message addressed to or from yourself in the
letter window. (These are the same messages which are
highlighted in the letter list.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>UseLynxNav</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Yes/No. See the description
under USAGE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ReOnReplies</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Yes/No. By popular demand. :-)
Setting this to &quot;No&quot; will disable the automatic
prefixing of &quot;Re: &quot; to the Subject when replying
-- except in areas flagged as Internet email or Usenet,
where this is the standard, and is still upheld.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>QuoteWrapCols</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Numeric. The right margin for
quoted material in replies (including the quote
indicator).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>MaxLines</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Numeric. See the description
under REPLY SPLITTING.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>outCharset</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">String. See the description
under CHARACTER SETS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>UseQPMailHead</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Yes/No. Controls the use of RFC
2047 encoding in outgoing mail headers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>UseQPNewsHead</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Yes/No. Controls the use of RFC
2047 encoding in outgoing news headers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>UseQPMail</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Yes/No. Controls the use of
quoted-printable encoding in outgoing mail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>UseQPNews</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Yes/No. Controls the use of
quoted-printable encoding in outgoing news.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ExpertMode</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Yes/No. If set to No, the
onscreen help menus are not shown; instead, the space is
used to extend the size of info windows by a few lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>IgnoreNDX</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Yes/No. This option applies
only to QWK packets. If set to yes, the *.NDX files are
always ignored, in favor of the &quot;new&quot; indexing
method that depends only on MESSAGES.DAT. This method is
slightly slower than the *.NDX-based indexing method (though
the delay is dwarfed by packet decompression time), but the
most common problem with QWK packets is corrupt *.NDX files.
MultiMail now recognizes some cases where the *.NDX files
are corrupt and switches automatically, but it doesn&rsquo;t
catch them all.</p>

<a name="UPGRADING"></a>
<h2>UPGRADING</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The basic
upgrade procedure is to simply copy the new executable over
the old one. No other files are needed. When you run a new
version of MultiMail (0.19 or later) for the first time, it
automatically updates your .mmailrc and ColorFile with any
new keywords. (Old keywords, and the values you&rsquo;ve set
for them, are preserved. However, comments are lost.) Some
notes on specific upgrades:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 0.48
adds the .mmailrc option &quot;Mouse&quot;, which allows you
to enable or disable mouse input (for instance, if you
don&rsquo;t want to see the mouse cursor).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 0.45
adds &quot;TempDir&quot;. Note that temporary files are
handled differently in this version, and the TEMP and TMP
environment variables are ignored. &quot;homeDir&quot; has
been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 0.43
adds &quot;ClockMode&quot;, and makes &quot;UseColors&quot;
available in all ports. Also note that CPU usage while idle
may be higher in some configurations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 0.41
adds the option &quot;IgnoreNDX&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 0.39
changes the function of the &quot;Transparency&quot; option
slightly. It now operates on the color set in
&quot;Main_Back&quot;, rather than Black. Also, if
you&rsquo;re accustomed to using the mouse to cut and paste
under X or gpm, note that you now have to hold down the
shift key while doing this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 0.38
adds &quot;ExpertMode&quot;, &quot;Transparency&quot;,
&quot;UseColors&quot;, and &quot;BackFill&quot;, while
removing the options &quot;BuildPersArea&quot;,
&quot;UseScrollBars&quot;, &quot;MakeOldFlags&quot;, and
&quot;AutoSaveRead&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 0.37
adds &quot;tarUncompressCommand&quot; and
&quot;tarCompressCommand&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 0.36
adds &quot;LetterMode&quot; and &quot;AreaMode&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 0.33
adds &quot;ReOnReplies&quot;, &quot;outCharset&quot;,
&quot;UseQPMailHead&quot;, &quot;UseQPNewsHead&quot;,
&quot;UseQPMail&quot; and &quot;UseQPNews&quot;; changes
some default values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 0.32
adds &quot;BuildPersArea&quot; and
&quot;MakeOldFlags&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 0.30
adds &quot;UserName&quot;, &quot;InetAddr&quot;,
&quot;QuoteHead&quot;, &quot;InetQuote&quot;, and
&quot;QuoteWrapCols&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 0.29
adds &quot;UseScrollBars&quot; and
&quot;UseLynxNav&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 0.28
adds &quot;MaxLines&quot;, &quot;StripSoftCR&quot;, and
&quot;BeepOnPers&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 0.26
adds &quot;AutoSaveReplies&quot;, &quot;AutoSaveRead&quot;,
and &quot;UseTaglines&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Version 0.25
adds &quot;Charset&quot;, &quot;PacketSort&quot;, and
&quot;LetterSort&quot;. The default packet sort is now by
time instead of name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
upgrading from 0.19 to 0.20 or later, and you have a
customized ColorFile, be sure to note the new options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ColorFile
is new in 0.19. Check it out (~/mmail/colors, by
default).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of 0.16, the
HOME environment variable can be overridden with MMAIL, or
omitted altogether.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
upgrading from a version before 0.9, and you have existing
reply packets (.rep or .new) whose names are partly or
wholly in uppercase, you must rename them to lowercase
before version 0.9 or higher will recognize them.
(Downloaded packets are not at issue.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
upgrading from a version below 0.8, you may want to manually
delete the /tmp/$LOGNAME directory created by previous
versions. (0.8 and higher clean out their own temp
directories, and use different names for each session.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
upgrading from a version prior to 0.7, please note the
changes in the default directories; previously they were
&quot;~/mmail/bwdown&quot;, etc.</p>

<a name="NOTES"></a>
<h2>NOTES</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike the
other archive types, tar/gzip recompresses the entire packet
when updating the .red flags, so it can be a bit slow. Also,
the supplied command lines assume GNU tar, which has gzip
built-in. Separated gunzip/tar and tar/gzip command lines
are possible, but would require a (simple) external script.
MultiMail only checks for the gzip signature, and does not
actually verify that the gzipped file is a tar file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OPX reply
packets are always created with a .rep extension, which
differs from the behavior of some other readers. If you
switch from QWK packets to OPX packets on the same board,
MultiMail will _not_ open an old QWK .rep in OPX mode, nor
vice versa. (It will try, and will terminate with
&quot;Error opening reply packet&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SOUP reply
packets are created with the name &quot;basename.rep&quot;,
where basename is the part of the original packet name
before the first period. (Unlike other formats,
there&rsquo;s no actual standard for this in SOUP, but this
seems to be the most common form among the SOUP readers I
surveyed.) Also, not that I expect anyone to try this, but
currently MultiMail is only able to read reply packets
generated by other SOUP readers if the replies are in
&rsquo;b&rsquo; or &rsquo;B&rsquo; mode, and are one to a
file within the packet. Most readers meet the first
criterion, but some of them batch all mail and news replies
into a single file for each type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When re-editing
a reply, it gets pushed to end of the list of replies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The R)ename
function in the packet window can also be used to move files
between directories; however, the destination filename must
still be specified along with the path.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
using the XCurses (PDCurses) version, and your editor
isn&rsquo;t an X app, it will work better if you set
MultiMail&rsquo;s &quot;editor&quot; keyword to &quot;xterm
&minus;e filename&quot; (instead of just
&quot;filename&quot;). I decided not to do this
automatically because someone might actually use it with an
X editor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Editing and
deletion of old replies are available through the REPLY
area, which always appears at the top of the area list. This
differs from Blue Wave and some other readers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Escape key
works to back out from most screens, but after you press it,
you&rsquo;ll have to wait a bit for it to be sensed (with
ncurses; not true with PDCurses).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only Blue Wave
style taglines (beginning with &quot;...&quot;) are
recognized by the tagline stealer. The tagline must be
visible on the screen to be taken.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Netmail only
works in Blue Wave, OMEN and OPX modes, and is still
slightly limited. Netmail from points includes the point
address. Internet email is available in Blue Wave and OPX
modes, for those doors that support it, and in SOUP mode,
using the same interface as Fido netmail.</p>

<a name="BUGS AND KNOWN PROBLEMS"></a>
<h2>BUGS AND KNOWN PROBLEMS</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Red Hat Linux
6.0 (and possibly 6.x) comes with a defective installation
of ncurses. When linked to this, MultiMail mostly works, but
odd effects appear when scrolling. (Users describe it as
double-spaced.) The problem can be fixed by reinstalling
ncurses from the source -- not the source RPM that comes
with Red Hat, but the original source from the ncurses site
(see INSTALL).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SOUP area type
&rsquo;M&rsquo; is not recognized. I have yet to find a
program that can generate one. :-)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ANSI viewer
eats a lot less memory than it used to, but it can still be
a problem. (Each character/attribute pair takes up four
bytes in memory. But lines which have the same attribute
throughout are stored as plain text.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The new file
