QWK Specifications
==================

Three traditional BBS-circulated documents about the QWK format, based on
reverse engineering; the official spec, excerpted from the documentation
of 1stReader; and the official QWKE specification, all re-formatted with
Markdown. Although I consider some of this material to be inaccurate,
I've tried to avoid editing for content, except to remove references to
web sites, boards and addresses that are no longer working.
